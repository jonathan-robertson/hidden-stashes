hiddenStashesTip01,Journal Tip,,"Hidden Stashes are containers you can craft, made to look like terrain.\n\nWhen buried underground and surrounded by other forms of terrain, they will stop rendering into the world, [00FF80]making it impossible to interact with them or see them with camera clipping exploits (xray)[-] until they're dug up again.\n\nKeep in mind that [FF0000]other players can access your hidden stashes as well[-], so here are some tips:\n  1. Monitor your surroundings for other players before accessing your stash\n  2. For maximum safety, bury your stash at least 2 blocks deep\n\nThese hidden stashes can be crafted to blend in with [00FF80]Topsoil[-], [00FF80]Dirt[-], [00FF80]Asphalt[-], [00FF80]Destroyed Stone[-], [00FF80]Gravel[-], or [00FF80]Stone[-].\n\nSimply search '[FF8000]hidden[-]' in the crafting menu to see these new hidden stash recipes."
