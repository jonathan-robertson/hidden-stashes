hiddenStashesTip01,Journal Tip,,"This is a primer for how to properly hide your stuff; not like some kind of goofball who simply buries his supplies in an obvious-looking chest, but like a real pro. As part of the White River Orientation Guide, you'll be walked through how to blend secured containers in with your surroundings so well that even the most observant among you will be unable to identify your secret container unless it's within arm's reach!\n\nWhat are we talking about? [00ff80]How to blend secured chest with terrain[-], of course!\n\nYou could place this right on top of some soil, but a true master of camouflage will [ff8000]bury this special kind of chest at least 1 or 2 blocks beneath the surface to avoid exposure[-] to some low-life looking at his feet while running through a field, probably naked. Like a maniac. Instead, give the maniac more of a challenge!\n\nAlso be aware of your surroundings as you visit your hidden stash: [ff007f]someone could always stalk you and watch from afar as you cover or dig up your sweet, sweet treasure[-]. But [00ff80]if an individual attempts to exploit by camera clipping (xray), that true psychopath will not be able to spot your hidden stash[-]. Accept defeat, psychopath!\n\nThese hidden stashes can be crafted to blend in with [00ff80]Topsoil[-], [00ff80]Dirt[-], [00ff80]Asphalt[-], [00ff80]Destroyed Stone[-], [00ff80]Gravel[-], or [00ff80]Stone[-].\n\nSimply search [ff8000]hidden[-] in the crafting menu to see these new hidden stash recipes."
