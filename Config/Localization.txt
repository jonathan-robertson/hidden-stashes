hiddenStashesTip01_title,Journal Tip,,"Hidden Stashes [FF8000][MOD]"
hiddenStashesTip01,Journal Tip,,"Hidden Stashes are containers you can craft, made to look like terrain.\n\nWhen buried underground and surrounded by other forms of terrain, they will stop rendering into the world, [00FF80]making it impossible to interact with them or see them with camera clipping exploits (xray)[-] until they're dug up again.\n\nIf you forget where you buried your hidden stash, consider investing some points into [FF8000]Treasure Hunter[-]. With this perk, crouching on the ground and remaining completely still for a period (to examine your surroundings) of time will reveal hidden stashes buried nearby.\n[FF8000]Treasure Hunter[-] [FF0000]can also help other players find YOUR hidden stashes as well[-], so here are some tips:\n  1. Monitor your surroundings for other players before accessing your stash\n  2. For maximum safety, bury your stash at least 6 blocks deep: harder to access, but also harder to find!\n\nThese hidden stashes can be crafted to blend in with [00FF80]Topsoil[-], [00FF80]Dirt[-], [00FF80]Asphalt[-], [00FF80]Destroyed Stone[-], [00FF80]Gravel[-], or [00FF80]Stone[-].\n\nSimply search '[FF8000]hidden[-]' in the crafting menu to see these new hidden stash recipes."
