7 Days to Die Modlet: Hide chests in plain sight or use terrain camo to defeat xray

## Features

Adds a variety of new crafting recipes and chests that can be placed to blend in with the environment.

Terrain chests (when surrounded by other terrain) will stop rendering. This fully defeats camera clipping and will prevent players from exploiting it to find your secret stash.

## Usage

Simply search "chest" in the crafting menu to see all new camo chest recipes.

## New Chests which look like

1. Topsoil
2. Dirt
3. More to come!
