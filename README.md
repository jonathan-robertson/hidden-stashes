## Summary

Add hidden stashes immune to detection by camera clipping/xray.

## Features

Adds a variety of new crafting recipes and chests that can be placed to blend in with the environment.

Terrain blocks (when surrounded by other terrain) will stop rendering colliding surfaces. This fully defeats camera clipping and will prevent players from exploiting it to find your hidden stashes.

### Can other players still interact with my stash?

Yes, they can - these hidden stashes work exactly like a secured chest would (other than looking like terrain).

If someone follows you to your stash location and they see you digging in the ground... then filling that ground back in, they'll know you're interacting with something that's buried and will probably go to check it out after you leave. So keep your eyes peeled and avoid frequent visits to your hidden stash locations until a visit is truly necessary or you are the only person on the server (hint!).

But if someone attempts to exploit by camera clipping (xray), they will not be able to spot your hidden stash.

## Usage

Simply search "hidden" in the crafting menu to see all new hidden stash recipes.
